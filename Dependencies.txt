# Steam Backup Manager - System Requirements

## Required Software

Your friend will need to install these **before** using the app:

### 1. **Ludusavi**
   - **What it is:** Game save backup tool that the app integrates with
   - **Download:** https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/releases
   - **Installation:** Download the latest release (Windows .exe version) and extract it to a folder
   - **Action:** The app will ask to locate this executable when first setting up

### 2. **Windows PowerShell** (usually pre-installed)
   - **What it is:** Used for displaying Windows notifications
   - **Check if installed:** Should already be on Windows 10/11
   - **If missing:** Download from Microsoft Store or Windows Update

## Optional But Recommended

### 3. **Steam Account**
   - Your friend needs a Steam account (free or paid games don't matter)
   - They'll need their Steam API Key from: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
   - They'll need their Steam64 ID from their profile URL

## Configuration Steps

Your friend needs to gather these before opening the app:

1. **Steam API Key**
   - Go to: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
   - Log in and request an API key (it's free)
   - Copy the key they receive

2. **Steam Profile ID (Steam64)**
   - Go to: https://steamcommunity.com/
   - Click their profile
   - Look at the URL: `https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/[STEAM64ID]`
   - Copy just the numbers (e.g., `76561198012345678`)

3. **Ludusavi Path**
   - Know where they extracted Ludusavi (e.g., `C:\Programs\Ludusavi\ludusavi.exe`)

4. **Backup Folder**
   - Choose or create a folder where backups will be stored (e.g., `C:\GameBackups\`)

## The Actual App

The Steam Backup Manager app itself (.msi installer) requires:
- **Windows 10 or later**
- **Internet connection** (for Steam API calls)
- **No other dependencies** - everything else is bundled

## Installation Instructions for Your Friend

1. Download the `.msi` file you send them
2. Double-click to run the installer
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Launch the app
5. Go to Settings tab and configure:
   - Steam API Key
   - Steam Profile ID
   - Ludusavi executable path
   - Backup folder location
6. Click "Save Configuration"
7. Go to Game Executables tab and set up games they want to monitor
8. Done!

## Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:
- **"Ludusavi not found"** → They need to install Ludusavi first
- **"Steam API error"** → Check the API key is correct
- **"No games loading"** → May take a minute on first load (it caches after)
- **Notifications not showing** → PowerShell needs to be enabled
